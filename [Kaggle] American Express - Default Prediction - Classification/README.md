# American Express Default Prediction Challenge: 
Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, 
which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. 
But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.
<br />American Express is a globally integrated payments company. The largest payment card issuer in the world, 
they provide customers with access to products, insights, and experiences that enrich lives and build business success.
<br />The objective of this competition is to predict the probability that a customer does not pay back their 
credit card balance amount in the future based on their monthly customer profile.

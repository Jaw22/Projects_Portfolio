* # Economic Well-Being Prediction Challenge: 
Granular information on economic well-being is extremely useful for governments, policy makers, and NGOs. But household surveys that capture this 
kind of information are expensive and conducted infrequently in many African countries. 
<br />For this competition we will attempt to create a workaround for this lack of data by building a model able to predict a measure of wealth as 
measured in household surveys using readily available inputs.
* # Table of Contents:
  1- Importing Libraries
<br />  2- EDA with some Visualizations
<br />  3- Date Preprocessing:
<br />   - Encoding (Frequency Encoder)
<br />   - Feature Engineering
<br /> 4- Creating a Special Test Set to Evaluate the Model (The Training and Testing datasets were gathered from different countries) 
<br /> 5- Define a LightGBM Model
<br /> 6- Define a Bagging Regressor Model with the LGBM Model as a Base Model
<br /> 7- Evaluating Against the Test Set
<br /> 8- Making the Final Prediction File

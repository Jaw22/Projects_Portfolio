* # Fossil Demand Forecasting Challenge:
Fossil (fossil.com) is a leading global fashion designer and manufacturer, famous for its watches, handbags, and other accessories. 
As a retailer of a wide variety of products, both overproduction and underproduction can pose problems for the business. 
Therefore predicting demand as accurately as possible is critical to Fossil. Because of the normal production lead time, 
Fossil needs accurate forecasts months in advance.
<br />The objective of this challenge is to build a forecasting or other predictive model to determine as accurately as possible the demand 
for each individual product, four months into the future. This model will enable Fossil to plan production more efficiently and better serve its customers.

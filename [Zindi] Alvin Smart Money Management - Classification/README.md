* # Alvin Smart Money Management Classification Challenge: 
Alvin is a smart money manager app that uses automated budgeting, personalised offers, and applied behavioural game design 
strategies to help people align their daily spending around their savings goals in a sustainable way.
<br />The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning algorithm that classifies purchases into 13 different categories. 
Alvin registers most transactions from MPESA notifications, but some users classify their purchases manually.
<br />This solution will help Alvin automatically classify expenditure into different categories, 
improving Alvinâ€™s services and offerings to their users.

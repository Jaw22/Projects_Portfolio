* # Layer.ai Air Quality Prediction: 
AirQoâ€™s air quality sensing network has more than 120 low-cost devices deployed across Uganda, which regulalry sense and report on air quality using the PM2.5 measure.
<br />In this challenge we explore using satellite radar data from Sentinel 5P to predict air quality in regions in Kampala. 
The use of satellite data could expand air quality predictions to areas without air quality sensor devices.
